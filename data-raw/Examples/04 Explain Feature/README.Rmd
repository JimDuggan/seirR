title:  Model Assumptions
---

<!-- README.md is generated from README.Rmd. Please edit that file -->
At any point, the current model assumptions can be displayed by calling the function **explain()**.

In this example, the model is loaded and checked, and then a parameter is changed, and the model assumptions checked again.

```{r}
library(seirR)
```


```{r}
mod <- create_seir_p()
explain(mod)
```

Change a parameter and call **explain()** again.
```{r}
mod <- set_param(mod,"distancing_flag",1)
```
