<!-- README.md is generated from README.Rmd. Please edit that file -->
The libraries are loaded

```{r,message=FALSE}
library(seirR)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(readsdr)
```

The model is run

```{r}
mod <- create_seir_p()

out1 <- run(mod)
```

Using dplyr, the results are aggregated

```{r}
weekly <- out1 %>% select(SimDay,Date,Week,Reported_Incidence) %>%
                   group_by(Week) %>%
                   summarise(WeeklyReportedIncidence=sum(Reported_Incidence),
                             WeekDate=max(Date)) %>%
                   arrange(Week)
```

The weekly values are then displayed
```{r}
ggplot(weekly,aes(x=WeekDate,y=WeeklyReportedIncidence))+geom_point()+geom_line()
```
